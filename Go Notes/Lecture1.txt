Go Language
	-> OpenSource
	-> Functionalities
		-> Simplicity, Scalability, Clarity
		-> High Performance & Focus on concurrency
		-> Standard Libraries & Code Features are built in.
		-> Static Typing
	
	Mostly Used in
		-> Networking and API's
		-> Microservices
		-> CLI Tools
	
List of Rules
	-> Package name is the mandatory.
	-> There are multiple ways to execute a go code one is to use "go run " command and another is to create executable file.
	-> Go can have multiple go file with package as main but one we cannot have the multiple main function in the main package.

Package
	-> Multiple go files can have the same package name. 
	-> It helps to reuse the code.
	-> The term "main" for the package is given to inform the compiler that where starting point of execution of the program.

Module
	-> Go understand both the module and package
	-> A single project has single module and inside that module it will have multiple packages.
	-> Command "go mod init <module-name>" create a go.mod file containing the module name and details.
	
Values & Types
	-> Variable name is prefered to be a camel Casing.
	-> We can declare variable and constant outside of the functions.
	
	-> Go infers the type of a variable based on the value assigned else one has to explicity define the type.
	-> var <list of variableName> <type> = <list of values>
	-> NOTE: Type needs to be assigned at last and same type is assigned to all the variable.
			OR 
	-> Other way to define a varibale ie to use (:=) to directly assign a value.
	
	Basic Typesx.
		-: int, float, string, bool
		-: Niche Basic Types (uint, int32 ....)
	
	Null Values
		:= int has 0
		:= float64 has 0.0
		:= string has ""
		:= bool has false
	
	Constant Values
		-> use the const keyword 

Formatting Strings
	fmt.Printf 
		-> %v (represent value of a varable)
		-> %.0f -> (f stands for float and 0 represent the precision of the float value )
	
	fmt.Sprintf
		-> Used to generate and store the value of the string in an varable
	
	fmt.Scan()
		-> Takes the single value input from the user via console.
	
	// Accepting the longer input use bufio package
		Eg: reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
			text, err := reader.ReadString('\n')					// Read the string till the next line. text variable will contain the \n as well which needs to be trimed.
			text = strings.trim(text, "\n")
			
	
	Multiline Strings
		We can use (``) to for multiline strings.

strconv package
	-> strconv package is used to convert the string to float, int ....

Functions
	-> Code on demand
	-> We can have multiple return types from a single function defined in curly braces.
	-> We can name the return type variable name while defining the function which creates a variable with default value. No need to return any thing in that case.
	
Control Statement
	-> if .. else if statements
	-> Does not requires the round bracket around the conditions.

For Loop
	-> Looping using break and continue.
	
	Conditional For Loops
		for someCondition {
				// do something ...
		}
		-> This loops runs till the conditions gets failed.
Switch:
	-> Runs based on choice


Writing to files:
	-> Use of Go standard library "os"
	-> os.WriteFile("messageSwitch.txt", []byte(msg), 0644) -> 0644 represent the permission

Error in GoLang
	-> We do not have try catch block in GoLang but we can check the error using the If else conditions

panic()
	-> It halts the program execution.
	-> It can output the error message panic("Can not process further")

Package in Go
	-> You can access the functions and variables of same package without importing it.
	-> We can create a multiple package with different names.
		-> The constraint with the package we have is that one folder can have one package name for all go files.
		-> You need to create a new subfolder for new sub package.
		-> The folder name and the package name should be same.
		
		-> While importing you need to give the project name(in go.mod file) followed by the package name.
				Eg: import "github.com/suraj8108/learnGo/newPackage"
		-> (IMP) In Go you can export the function, variable and constant only if that starts with the uppercase. Else it can not be imported.

Pointers
	What are Pointers
	-> Variable that stores address instead of value.
	-> Go has a Garbage collector which is a process that cleans up unused data.
	
	Advantage of Pointers
		-> Avoid Unnecessary value copies
		-> Direct Mutate values.
	
	-> The null value of the pointer in Go is "nil" - a special value built in Go.
	-> nil represents the absence of an address value - i.e., a pointer pointing at no address / no value in memory.


Struct & Custom Types
	Struct is like grouping of the different common variables.
	Eg: type <struct-name First upercase name defines that whether its public or not> struct {}
	You can also pass the struct as the parameter as a value or the pointer reference.
	
	We can attach the functions to the struct.
	func (<variableName> structName) functionName() {}
	
	NOTE: When a function is associated to a struct it can be associated either as value or as pointer. (<variableName> structName) OR (<variableName> *structName). 
		  There no much difference between them its just that operation performed on struct field in pointer one will do the changes in that original struct but same wont happen 
		  with the value one.
	
	Function Used to create a new Struct (Constructor) -:
		This function accepts the list of parameter of struct and return the new struct pointer.
		Generally the Contructor name is given as "New" and it may contain the validation logic.
	
	Package in Struct:
		We can export the struct outside of the package by keeping the fist letter of the struct as Uppercase.
		NOTE: Just keeping the first letter of struct as Upper case does not makes the field of struct as public. 
			  We can keep the few fields of struct as accessible outside of package and few as a private by following the upper case logic.
	
	Struct Embedding (In Java it refers to as an Inheritance):
		The child struct has the abilities of the parent struct like its fields and methods access.
		Egs:
			type Admin struct {						type Admin struct {
				fname	string							email 	string
				lname	string							pass 	string
				birthDate string						user 	User
			}										}
	
	Struct Tags:
		-> Its a meta data that we can add to the field of struct which names the field while exporting to the JSON.
		Eg: type Note struct {
				Title string `json:"title"`
			}
		

Custom Type in Go
	-> We can create alias to the built in type and use it.
	Eg: type str string;
		var name str;		//Here str acts like an alias for string.
	-> The main use case of this is to extend the builtin types and add a new functions to it.
		Eg func (str) printMyString() {}
