2.1 Interfaces in Go
	-> Its like a contract if signed you will have to implement all the functions of the interface.
	-> Eg: type <interface_name> interface {
			Save() error
		}
	-> Interface os of type so it can be passed as parameter.
	-> Two struct if implements all the function of interface then it can be used as one of the type of interface.
	
	Embedded Interface
		We can have interface inside another interface. It depicts that the struct that implements the outer interface should implement all the methods of the inner 
		interface as well
		Eg: type student interface{
				getName()
				getRoll()
			}
			
			type monitor interface {
				student,
				getClassName()
			}
	
	Any parameter
		-> In go we define a parameter type "interface {}" which depicts this accepts any type of value.
		-> You can alternativly use "any". That is an alias for the special "any value is allowed" type.
	
	Working with type 
		We can check the type of incoming interface
		Eg: value.(type) // returns data type of an interface value. It works only with switch
	
	Extracting Type Information
		We can extract the value from the given interface.
			// value is an interface. Below we are converting interface to int.
		Eg: typedVal, ok := value.(int)  // typedVal get the original value where Go knows its type and ok returns boolean is value of type int or not.
			typesVal1, ok := value1.(int) // Converting value1 interface to int.
			
			// value1 + value2   -> This will give an error as interface addition operation can not be performed.
			// typedVal + typesVal1 -> This will not give an error.

	
	Generics in Go:
		We can give generic names to the interface and use that as the type.

2.2 Arrays in Java
	-> Defining array 
		var <variableName> [<length>]string
		Similar to java we can access and update the arrays.
	-> 	Slices -> A window of an array.
			newArray := array[0:3] // 0 included and 3 excluded
			Slices is an part of window of an array, Any change in the value of sliced element it will change it in the original array as well.
	-> 	len(<sliceName>), cap(<sliceName>) // len share the number of element currently present and cap shares the whole capacity of the slice.
			newArray :=  []string {"Suraj", "Anand", "Astha", "Jyoti"}
			sliceElem := newArray[1:3]
			len(sliceElem) 	// Outputs 2
			cap(sliceElem)  // Outputs 3 because slice takes the whole right capacity of newArray, capacity is extendable to right not to the left.
		
	Dynamic List with slices
		prices := []float64 {10.99, 8.99} 	// Dynamic sizing of the slice
		updatedSlices := append(prices, 5.99)				// Append creates a new slice and appends the value to it.
	
	To Merge different slices we can use (...) operator
	goals1 := []string {"A", "B"}
	goals2 := []string {"C", "D"}
	goals4 := append(goals1, goals2...)

2.3 Map in Go Lang
	-> Creating Map syntax
		map[string]string		-> map[<datatype or customtype>]<datatype or customtype>
		websites := map[string]string {"google" : "google.com"}
		googleURL := websites["google"]
		delete(googleURL , "google")
		
2.4 make() functions
	
	Advatage of using make function is that go has to each time allocate a memory if we create a slice or map by basice approach whenever there is an increase
	in the size, but using make function we can allocate some predefined size and go will create that slice or map for the first time with that much size.
	
	Slices
	-> syntax make([]string, 2)			// make([]<slicetype>, <optional, intialsize a size of an array>, <optional, maximum number of array elements allowed>)
		// Make at start initalizes the array with size provided and adding default value to it.
	
		
	Map
		-> make(map[string]string, 3)	// make(map[string]string, 3)
		
	Type Alias 
		We can create a type alias and use it in make function. 
		
		type floatMap map[string]string;
		func (m floatMap) output() {
			fmt.Println(m);
		}
		websites :=	make(floatMap, 2)
		websites["google"] = "google.com"
		websites.output();
	
	For loops
		-> Slices
			for index, user := range userNames {}
		-> Maps
			for key, value := range websites {}
			
		
2.5 Depeer in to Functions
	1. Using function as parameter value
		-> We can pass function as the parameter in the another function
		-> Eg: func usersMotherLanguage(user string, getUserMotherLanguage func (string) string)
		
		-> Alias Function Type 
			We can also assign an alias to the function name and pass it to the function
			type fetchMLanguage func(string) string
			func usersMotherLanguage(user string, getUserMotherLanguage fetchMLanguage)
		
		-> We can similarly do for returning functions as value in Go as we did for passing a function as parameter.
			
			
	2. Anonymous function
		-> We can create an anonymous function in an single line and pass it to the function as parameter
		
		-> Passing Anonymous function as a parameter
			func performAddition(a int, b int, func(int, int) int { 
				return a + b;
				})
		
		-> Returning Anonymous function 
			-> We can return the anonymous functions from the another function as shown below.
			Eg: func translateNumber(factor int) func (int) int {
				return func(int number) int {
					return number*factor;   		// factor variable gets lockedin in this function
				}
			}
		-> Closures
			-> Every anonymous function is a closure.
			-> If we use the variable from outer scope in an anonymous function then it gets locked in to the anonymous function. This is called closure.
			
				
				
	3. Recursion
		-> Same as Java
	4. Variadic function
		-> Functions where we can pass multiple argument by just defining one single parameter in the function
		-> Eg: func sumup(number ...int) {}

2.6 Concurrency - Running tasks in parallel
	GoRoutines
		-> Running program parallely.
		-> If we use the following term it dispatches to goroutine
			go fmt.Println("Hello");
	
	Channel
		-> Mode of communication while working with goroutine
		-> Creating a channel
			done := make(chan bool)
			go greet(done)				// Passing channel to goroutine
		
		-> Updating data in goroutine
			done <- true
		
		-> Channel is the medium to call the goRoutines, if we do not call the channel we wont be calling the goroutine
	
	Select:
		-> It is similar to switch statement with cases where in cases it selects the channel
		-> The first channel that is set in the goroutine will be called in the switch statement.

IMP Points to Note:
	=> DB.Exec() (when we created the tables)

	=> Prepare() + stmt.Exec() (when we inserted data into the database)

	=> DB.Query() (when we fetched data from the database)

	=> Using Prepare() is 100% optional! You could send all your commands directly via Exec() or Query().
		The difference between those two methods then just is whether you're fetching data from the database (=> use Query()) or your manipulating the 
		database / data in the database (=> use Exec()).
	
		But what's the advantage of using Prepare()?
			-> Prepare() prepares a SQL statement - this can lead to better performance if the same statement is executed multiple times (potentially with different 
				data for its placeholders).
			-> This is only true, if the prepared statement is not closed (stmt.Close()) in between those executions. In that case, there wouldn't be any advantages.
			-> And, indeed, in this application, we are calling stmt.Close() directly after calling stmt.Exec(). So here, it really wouldn't matter which 
			approach you're using.
			
Middleware 
	-> We can register the middleware in two ways
		
		First Way
			We can add multiple middleware passing from left to right in the below function
			
			Eg: server.POST("/events", middleware.Authenticate, eventHandler.CreateEvent)
		
		Second Way
			We need to group the routes and then apply the middleware in one go.
